## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Bridging Intent and Execution
The skill SHALL establish a mental framework defining the boundary between OpenSpec (immutable intent/requirements) and `td` (mutable execution state) as its primary philosophy before providing procedural instructions.

#### Scenario: Agent initializes the skill
- **WHEN** the skill is loaded by the agent to handle a request regarding OpenSpec conversion
- **THEN** it prioritizes the philosophical context of "execution state" over simplistic raw ticket mapping
